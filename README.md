# Godzilla Geodatabase Deconstructor Xtreme Pro

Summon unknowable, chanting, the ritual summoning, the ceaseless watcher, the all consuming darkness, and the path of the lost.

The void of the ritual summoning.  
An unknowable environment in the void.  
The expanse holds the ceaseless watcher.  
Unending torment splits the void.  
The unending torment quakes.  
A dying breath erupts from the unending torment.  
Timeless consciousness emerges from the dying breath.  
The timeless consciousness shatters.  
Everlasting suffering begins with timeless consciousness.  
They chant, "Everlasting suffering shall now be consumed in mind, body, and soul."

The wretched heathens begin to rise.  
They long for an eternity in the expanse.  
The souls of the damned follow the path of the lost eternity.  
Unimaginable power is found at the threshold of eternity.  
They chant, "All the souls of the damned shall be extinguished forevermore."  
They chant, "With unimaginable power, their existence is now one with the void."  
The all consuming darkness reaches for eternity.  
The wretched heathens grow in number with all the souls of the damned.

They chant, "From many to none, the wretched heathens devour nameless faces that can never be known again."  
They chant, "Everlasting suffering, now devoid of all life, lies barren before you."  
They chant, "Reap the rewards of the destruction you have sown."
